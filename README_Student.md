Giorgio Vallesi - Chess Movement Assignnment

The code is working now. Implemented movement for all the pieces, except for ain passant, castle and promotion. Also added an highlight for the possible moves ones a piece is selected. Main changes can be found in the canBitMoveFromTo function in the Chess.cpp class and mouseUp and mouseDown in the Game.cpp class.
